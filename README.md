## Features
- **Black Hole**: WebGL-powered with shader-based lensing and particle accretion disk.
- **Quantum Orbs**: Physics-driven navigation links with mouse reactivity and entanglement effects.
- **Data Singularity**: Input text to create fragments that orbit and get consumed.

## Dependencies
